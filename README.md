# React Immersive Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you
can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:

![checkpoint demo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-2/phase-2-hooks-code-challenge-bot-battlr/checkpoint_demo.gif)

Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web
developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through
a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

## Instructions

For this project, you’ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right
places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `8000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `3000`.

Make sure to open [http://localhost:8000/bots](http://localhost:8000/bots) in
the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:8000`

## What You Already Have

`BotPage` is the highest component below App, and serves as the main container
for all of the pieces of the page.

`BotCollection` and `YourBotArmy` are container components, which are children
of `BotPage`. `BotCollection` is where all the bots will be displayed, while
`YourBotArmy` (the green portion on the top of the screen) will only display the
bots that have been selected by the user.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
